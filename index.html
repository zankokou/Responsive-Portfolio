           Hi there! My name is Kenneth Huynh.  You can call me Ken. 
           I am currently a Lv1 Coder on the journey to be a Master Web Developer.
           So far, I have Lv1 Mastery of HTML and a Lv1 Mastery of CSS. 
           This webpage took me over 10 hours alone! That is quite a long time! 
           Before going on this journey I went to school at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
           I studied Finance and worked in the Insurance Industry.  It was a cool gig but it did not fill my need to be creative with my imagination.
           <br>
        
           Growing up I was full of ideas, whether it was thinking of games to play, writing short stories, or playing with Legos.
           I have left that part of myself in the shadows for a while.. BUT NO MORE! 
           Learning to code is my outlet to use my creativity and do something that I am passionate about.
           Oh and look at that! Just leveled up to Lv2 Coder! Woo! 

        </p>
